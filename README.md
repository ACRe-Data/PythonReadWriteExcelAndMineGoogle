# Python Read and Write MS Excel and Mine Google
Python Tutorial: How to Read-Write Excel Files, Web-Scrape Google and Create Interactive Maps in 20 lines of Code

The following short article shows just how simple it is to use Python programming language in a data science project. In this example, we’ll first go to Statista.com (public dataset provider) and download the MS Excel dataset that contains the list of 100 largest companies in the world. The file that contains only two columns, the company name and their current market value. Our goal is to use Python to read the rows and cells inside the Excel file and use it to search the internet for some additional information, such as the company’s headquarters location and it’s map coordinates (latitude and longitude). You’ll see how easily this can be done by using Python web-scraping capabilities. We’ll also show how to write the newly found information back into the Excel sheet and use it to create an infographic that shows the headquarter location of 100 of the world’s top companies on the map.
